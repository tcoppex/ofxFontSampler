**ofxFontSampler** is a *TrueType Font* (TTF) glyph path extractor and renderer designed to finely sample glyphes from a font.

It was somewhat inspired by Ken Perlin's blog post [*"Unfont Design"*](http://blog.kenperlin.com/?p=16961).

### Overview

The project consist of two parts : 

* **FontSampler**, a *TrueType Font* (TTF) file parser and a glyph path extractor designed to handle type 4 CMAP format and working as a standalone c++ library.
* **ofxFontSampler**, an openframework addons interfacing with *FontSampler*.

### Example

The example display iteratively the 26 uppercase letters of the latin charset (*A to Z*) with different animated contour sampling, their mesh being triangulated using the [ofxTriangleMesh](https://github.com/tcoppex/ofxTriangleMesh) addon.

### Limitations

* **FontSampler** is intended to be used at the glyph (*ie. character*) level, you can certainly write text with it but no support is given.
* It was designed to handle TTF using **type 4 CMAP** (*cf. TrueType Reference*). Most TrueType fonts support it, but some don't.
* Composites glyphes, like letters with accent (*eg. "Ã©"*), are not supported.
* It is more of a working prototype which would need work on the memory management side to be production ready.
